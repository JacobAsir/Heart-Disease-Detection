# Heart-Disease-Detection
Built a Heart Disease Detection Model 💓🧠

I’m excited to share my recent project where I developed a predictive model for heart disease detection using machine learning. Here’s a brief overview:

➖Data Preparation & EDA: Loaded the dataset, visualized relationships (e.g., Cholesterol vs. Blood Pressure), and analyzed heart disease cases by Age Group & Gender.📊

➖Feature Engineering: Processed and cleaned data, then identified key features using Random Forest.🌲

➖Model Building: Developed models using Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict heart disease.⚙️

➖Prediction: Tested models on random patient data, demonstrating strong predictive capabilities.🔍

This project highlights the impact of data science in healthcare.
